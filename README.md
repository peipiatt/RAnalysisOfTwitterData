# RAnalysisOfTwitterData
R analysis of twitter data gathered from my Twitter scraping app. 

count x id.png is the bar graph of each Tweet id by the number of times it was collected. 
This was made to understand how many redundant tweets were gathered. Initially I wanted to only gather discrete tweets but my program doesn't do that. In the future I'd like to update it to only gather discrete tweets. 

This graph shows how many unique tweets were gathered. There should be around 500. 

favorite_count vs id.pdf is the favorite counts graphed for each Tweet id. The goal of this graph is to understand which Tweet ids are the most popular. I hope in the futre to make an interactive program with D3.js or 3.js to be able to click on a Tweet id and see more information about the Twitter user.
